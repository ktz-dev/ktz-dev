## About Me

I'm a professional Quality Assurance (QA) specialist with a keen eye for detail and a passion for delivering top-notch software. Outside of my professional work, I love diving into code to learn how tech functions and why sometimes it might choose not to. These projects help me explore new technologies and deepen my understanding of computers.

## What I Do

- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring software quality through rigorous testing and detailed analysis.
- **Web Development**: Building and experimenting with web technologies to enhance my skills and create interesting projects.
- **Learning**: Continuously exploring new technologies, programming languages, and best practices in both QA and development.
